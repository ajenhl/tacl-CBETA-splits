  <!-- This file splits T0418-ex verses into "revised" and
       "unrevised".  It accounts for the fact that on Harrison's
       analysis, the base text of T (K), and witnesses aligned with
       it, preserve the unrevised text only in part, to line 907c7;
       from 907c8 onwards, someone later in the tradition spliced it
       with the revised version, which in all essential respects is
       identical with SYMP.

       The overall process results in four different types of material
       for T0418:

       1. unrevised: CB大宮麗-CB only, to T907c7
       2. revised ex-verse, which is in turn subdivided into:
         2a. revised ex-verse for CB大宮麗-CB, after 907c8 only
         2b. revised ex-verse for SYMP, covering the span of the whole text
       3. revised verse, which (at least in principle) exists for all witnesses

       (it remains to be seen whether in practice, CB大宮麗-CB contain
       any verses that this the process extracts.  -->
